# 12-Employee-Tracker

## Description

This project is an attempt to create a program that will allow users to view & manipulate employee data within an employee database. Initially running this program will reveal a list of options the user can select to take action upon the database. These actions include viewing, adding, or updating employees data within the database. This data includes employee names, roles, departments, managers, salaries, & much more. Each time a user views or manipulates the database, the user will immediately be greeted with a table in the database that reflects the user's previous actions. This project was constructed with inquirer, seperate modules, and the use of a database connection.
